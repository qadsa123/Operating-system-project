<h3>Phase I (Ludo board game)	</h3>
 
Ludo is a strategy board game for two to four players, in which the players race their four tokens from start to finish according to the rolls of a single dies. This project consists of designing a multithreaded application of Ludo for four players each having maximum four tokens. Two, three or four can play, without partnerships. At the beginning of the game, each player’s tokens are out of play and staged in the player's yard (one of the large corner areas of the board in the player's color). When able to, the players will enter their tokens one per time on their respective starting squares, and proceed to race them clockwise around the board along the game track (the path of squares not part of any player’s home column).  When reaching the square below his home column, a player continues by moving tokens up the column to the finishing square.
